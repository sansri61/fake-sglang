"""The prefill/decode rendezvous.

This is a *real* cross-process handshake over HTTP, not a mocked one. That
matters: it is the part of disaggregation most likely to be misconfigured in a
deployment (wrong advertised host, port collision, dead peer), and a fake that
skipped it would hide exactly the failures worth rehearsing. Only the KV
payload itself is simulated -- see :mod:`fakeengine.transfer`.

The route shape follows SGLang's ``CommonKVBootstrapServer``
(``disaggregation/common/conn.py``): ``GET /health``, ``PUT /route`` for rank
registration, ``GET /route`` for topology. ``/room/{id}`` is ours -- SGLang
carries per-request metadata over ZMQ rather than HTTP, and HTTP keeps the fake
engine dependency-light.
